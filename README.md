# InstantPedia

The InstantPedia is a Wikipedia-inspired application that applies to all Android devices. Developed using Java on the MVVM framework and SQLite, the application keeps accessibility in mind. The application is capable of offline access by downloading the database directly onto your device. It was designed to defy any internet censorship or connectivity barriers.

Utilized and adapted Wikimedia's open-source data, and combined it with custom data storage structure to shrink Wikipedia's massive database to just a quarter of its size, without sacrificing retrieval speed.

Available to download on Google Play.
